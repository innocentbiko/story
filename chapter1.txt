Psycho is a slang term for someone who is mentally unstable or afflicted with a psychosis.
 Your best friend risks looking like a psycho if she keeps stalking her ex-boyfriend months after their breakup.

Psycho comes from the Greek word psykho, which means mental.
 Although the word has long been used as a prefix in words like psychologist,
  the pejorative term for a psychopath has only existed since the twentieth century.
   The word gained further notoriety after the 1960 release of Alfred Hitchcock's thriller
    "Psycho." If you're always describing your boss as a psycho,
 you might want to think about looking for a new job.

DELUSIONAL
 A delusional person believes things that couldn't possibly be true.
  If you're convinced that the microwave is attempting to control your thoughts, you are, sadly, delusional.
   Delusional comes from a Latin word meaning "deceiving."
  So delusional thinking is kind of like deceiving yourself by believing outrageous things
